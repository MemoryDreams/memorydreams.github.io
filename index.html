                <h3>Welcome to my personal page!</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Vincent and I do pixel art, write articles and make webpages. You may find my portfolio on lower part of this page. You can also find my contacts below it.<br>
                    One of my passions is videogames. I like playing them, analyzing them and hopefully I'll start making them soon!<br>
                    Some of my favorite games include Legacy of Kain series, Devil May Cry 3, Dark Souls, Dragons Dogma, Silent Hill series, Metal Gear series and original MediEvil duology.<br>
                    I also like music. I play guitar, keyboard and a kalimba, though I'm far from being good at it. I consider myself to be a music enjoyer. Here's what I mean by it: I like breathtaking, beautiful music. Among my favorite musicians are Ludovico Einaudi, The Doors, Crumb and KGLW. I also hate earworms and take it rather serious to avoid them.<br>
                    Make yourself at home!
