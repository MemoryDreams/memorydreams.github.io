                 Hard to tell, but it's actually a pixelart. I would know since I was the one to put every pixel with love and care it deserves. 
                 One could call this image an accident. One day I saw a girl who looked like that. I thought she was so cute that I immediately thought of drawing her. On the back of her jacket was written something like "*something* Boutique", which reminded me of a band I used to listen back then. 
                 A few days later, the art is finished.
