                 Another very cute lady I've never met in person. Basically she's a witch who carries a firetail bird under her hat.<br>
                 There're lots of things in this picture I don't like. It's due to lack of experience. But some things turned out to be so good I'm really proud of them. The hair, for example, is really good looking in my opinion. Though it did look better before I added the nest there. Which is why you can notice how I tried to hide the nest so that it wouldn't get in a way of hair. <br>
                 I also like the hat. I finally managed to make it not too huge. <br>
                 You may also notice lots of dithering on this one. One of my goals was to get good at it and I am satisfied with the result.<br>
                 This lady represents my love for birds. A few years ago I discovered that birds have a language of their own and any human can learn it. I never got to learn it though, but the idea of people understanding the birdtongue excites me.
