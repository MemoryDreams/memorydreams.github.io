                 It's the lead singer from Skating Polly. I really like how she looks in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ahvxACX5Q">Hail Mary</a> video. Also I spent most of the day on her face and by the time I got to everything else, I completely burned out. The original plan was to make a full scene with couch and legs, but it didn't work out. I was thinking of croping everything but the head but ultimately managed to finish some parts with mid quality. Oh well!
