                        Personal Projects: <br>
                        <br>
                        1. MicroVania <br>
                        <br>
                        Description: Developed a 2D metroidvania game on my own using Unity game engine. The game features 3 levels, movement and shooting mechanics, 5 enemy types, wallsliding and room-to-room transitions. All in-game art and animations were made by me. <br>
                        Skills: C#, Unity <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Breakout <br>
                        <br>
                        Desctiption: A simple Arcanoid-clone, developed on my own, using Pico-8 engine. The game was developed almost from scratch, using Lua language. It features 6 levels, and 3 powerups. <br>
                        Skills: Lua, Pico-8 <br>
                        <br>
                        3. Web-based sketchbook <br>
                        <br>
                        Description: A simple app for drawing pixel art, written in html, css and javascript, from scratch. It features 3 canvas sizes, customization of color, pencil, ereser, bucket tool, color selector, rainbow pencil and rainbow bucket tool, line tool and save image feature. This project was made as a part of Odin Project web course, but was over engineered to the point of being a general drawing app. What sets it apart from any other beginner project, is a complex algorythm that fills the gaps between the pixels when drawing quickly.<br>
                        Skills: JavaScript <br>
